"""SALTFPCALPROFILE fits a Voigt profile to one or more calibration rings,
displays the fit, and records the fit parameters for later use. It uses T. Williams code.  The code assumes all the files are in the same directory. Also assumes that if there is a config file, it is also in the same directory as the data. Note that this config file is in the original FORTRAN code format so that the user does not have to write another file.

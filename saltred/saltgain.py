"""
SALTGAIN corrects the multiplies images by a constant factor appropriate for gain
correction. Each CCD in SALT's SALTICAM and RSS instruments has two
readout nodes, SALTICAM has a two-CCD mosaic and RSS has a three-CCD
mosaic. Each amplifier has a specific gain factor which varies slowly
over time but which is constant across the amplifiers. Gain values
depend on the readout speed and gain setting of the CCD. For all
possible permutations, gains are stored in an ascii table which is
updated periodically. Saltgain extracts gains from the ascii table and
applies them to raw data.

New gain and readout noise values will be written to the header
keywords of each HDU. Keyword writing can also occur without peforming
the gain correction itself. If the gain correction is performed, a
keyword, GAINMULT is added to the image extension with the value
1.0. If the gain correction is not performed, GAINMULT wil contain the
gain factor recorded in the ascii table. The purpose of the GAINMULT
keyword is to report what multiplicative factor is required to gain
correct an image.

Based on data in image keywords, e.g. gain setting, readout speed and
amplifier number, saltgain will extract the correct gain and readout
noise values from the ascii table and update keywords and optionally
perform the gain correction.  

Optionally, saltgain will extract the values from the data headers
and perform the gain correction using those values

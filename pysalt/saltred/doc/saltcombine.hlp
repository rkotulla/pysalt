NAME
saltcombine -- Combine SALT images 
.ih
USAGE
saltcombine images outimage (combine) (reject) (mask) (weight) (blank) (scale)
(statsec) (lthresh) (hthresh) (clobber) (logfile) (verbose) 
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls images
String. List of input images including, if necessary, absolute or
relative paths to the data. Data can be provided as a comma-separated
list, or a string with a wildcard (e.g. 'images=S20061210*.fits'), or
a foreign file containing an ascii list of image filenames. For ascii
list option, the filename containing the list must be provided
preceded by a '@' character, e.g. 'images=@listoffiles.lis'. The input
files will be overwritten with the gain-corrected data. 
.le
.ls outimage
String. This is the name of the output image to be created.  This image
is the combined image of all of the input images.
.le
.ls combine
String. Method for combining the data.  The different options are 
average and median.  
.le
.ls reject 
String. Method for rejecting the data.  The different options are 
None, ccdclip, and sigclip.  ccdclip uses the variance in the data
to reject pixels based on the expected noise.  sigclip rejects pixels that
are outside of the thresholds set by hthresh and lthresh.
.le
.ls mask
Bool. If set to 'yes', the BPM frames in the data will be used to 
reject pixels
.le
.ls weight
Bool. If set to 'yes', the inverse variances frames in the data will be used to 
produce a weighted average of the data.
.le
.ls blank
Real. Value to use if there are no useful pixels at a position
.le
.ls scale 
String. Type of multiplicative scaling.  If it is set to 'average', it will use
the 'average' of the section specified in statsec to scale the images. Likewise 
for the 'median'.  
.le
.ls statsec
String. Section to use for calculating the value to scale by.  Leave blank to use
the whole image.
.le
.ls lthresh
Real. Lower threshold to reject pixels for 'ccdclip' or 'sigclip'
.le
.ls hthresh
Real. Upper threshold to reject pixels for 'ccdclip' or 'sigclip'
.le
.ls (verbose)
Boolean. If verbose=n, log messages will be suppressed.

DESCRIPTION
SALTCOMBINE is a tool for combining images into a master image.  The program 
has a number of options for how the images are combine including the combination 
and rejection methods.

The task assume that all input images are of the same size and type.
Options for combining the sources are average or median.  For average 
combination, a weighted average can be applied if inverse variance frames are 
included with the data.   To include inverse variance frames, the extension of 
the frames should be included using the IVAREXT keyword in the corresponding 
data extension.   Also, if the BPMEXT keyword is set, it will also use the bad 
pixel maps for rejecting pixels.


Options for rejection only include ccdclip and sigclip.  If 'ccdclip' is
selected, the gain and readnoise will be extracted from the image header and 
used to calculate the expected variance in the frames.  The task will check to
see if the data have already been gain corrected and use the appropriate value
if they have been. If 'sigclip' is selected, the standard deviation of the 
pixels being averaged will be calculated for use in the rejection. Any source 
outside of the thresholds set by lthresh and hthresh will be rejected.  

Prior to combining the images, the images can be multiplicatively scaled. The
user can set the scale statistic to either calculate the mean or the median
of a region statsec.  The images will then be scaled by that value.   If statsec
is left blank, the scaling will be based on the statistics of the entire image.

EXAMPLES
1. To combine a set of SALT images into a master flat:

.nf
    --> saltcombine images='@images.lis' outimage='VFLAT.fits'
    	logfile='salt.log' verbose='yes'
.fi

.ih
TIME AND DISK REQUIREMENTS
Individual unbinned full frame RSS image files can be 112MB in size. It is
recommended to use workstations with a minimum of 512MB RAM. On a
linux machine with 2.8 Ghz processor and 2 Gb of RAM, one 2051x2051 image can 
be processed in 0.31 sec.

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
Not all features available in iraf.ccdred.combine are available
for SALTCOMBINE.

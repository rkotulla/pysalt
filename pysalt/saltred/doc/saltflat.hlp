NAME
saltflat -- Flatfield correct SALT images
.ih
USAGE
saltflat images outimages outpref flatimage (minflat) (clobber)  (logfile) (verbose)
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls images
String. List of input images including, if necessary, absolute or
relative paths to the data. Data can be provided as a comma-separated
list, or a string with a wildcard (e.g. 'images=S20061210*.fits'), or
a foreign file containing an ascii list of image filenames. For ascii
list option, the filename containing the list must be provided
preceded by a '@' character, e.g. 'images=@listoffiles.lis'. 
.le
.ls outimage
String. A list of images. Data can be provided as a comma-separated
list, or a string with a wildcard (e.g. 'outimages=rS20061210*.fits'), or
a foreign file containing an ascii list of image filenames. For ascii 
list option, the filename containing the list must be provided 
preceded by a '@' character, e.g. 'outimages=@listoffiles.lis'. This list
must be of the same size as the images argument list. 
.le
.ls outpref
String. If the outpref string is non-zero in length and contains
characters other than a blank space, it will override any value of the
outimages argument. Output file names will use the name list provided
in the images argument, but adding a prefix to the basename of
each  output file defined by outpref. An absolute or relative directory 
path can be included in the prefix, e.g. 'outpref=/Volumes/data/p'.
.le
.ls flatimage
String.  File to use for flatfielding the data.  This file should
be the same format and size of the input data.   The file will be
normalized by the task prior to applying to the data.
.le
.ls minflat  
Real.  Minimum value for the flatfield image.  Any pixels above 
this value will be replaces with this value.
.le
.ls clobber 
Hidden boolean. If set to 'yes' files contained within the outpath
directory will be overwritten by newly created files of the same
name.
.le
.ls logfile
String. Name of an ascii file for storing log and error messages
written by the task. The file may be new, or messages can also be
appended to a pre-existing file.
.le
.ls (verbose)
Boolean. If verbose=n, log messages will be suppressed.

DESCRIPTION
SALTFLAT corrects a SALT image for flatflied variations.  

The task reads in the flatfield image, flatimage.  The flatimage will have
any bad pixels below the minflat value replace by the minflat value.  Then,
the image will be normalized by its mean.

After normalizing the flatimage, SALTFLAT will divide flatimage
into each of the images supplied here.   If the images have variance
frames, SALTFLAt will also propogate the errors through to the variance
frames.

If the users wishes to only correct for pixel to pixel variations
or illumination corrections, these images can be applied here
but the flatimage would have to be prepared prior to running this
task.

EXAMPLES
1. To flat field correct a SALT image:
.nf
    --> saltflat images='@images.lis' outimages='' outpref='f'
        flatimage='FLAT.fits' minflat=1 clobber='yes'
    	logfile='salt.log' verbose='yes'
.fi

.ih
TIME AND DISK REQUIREMENTS
Individual unbinned full frame RSS image files can be 112MB in size. It is
recommended to use workstations with a minimum of 512MB RAM. On a
linux machine with 2.8 Ghz processor and 2 Gb of RAM, one 2051x2051 image can 
be processed in 0.31 sec.
.ih
BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
SALTFLAT will only correct by the image given to it and no other process 
is applied to the data. SALTFLAT will not check to make sure that the 
data are the right type, but will blindly apply the correction.

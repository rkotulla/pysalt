NAME
saltillum -- Divide an image by its median
.ih
USAGE
saltillum images outimages outpref mbox (clobber)  (logfile) (verbose)
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls images
String. List of input images including, if necessary, absolute or
relative paths to the data. Data can be provided as a comma-separated
list, or a string with a wildcard (e.g. 'images=S20061210*.fits'), or
a foreign file containing an ascii list of image filenames. For ascii
list option, the filename containing the list must be provided
preceded by a '@' character, e.g. 'images=@listoffiles.lis'. 
.le
.ls outimage
String. A list of images. Data can be provided as a comma-separated
list, or a string with a wildcard (e.g. 'outimages=rS20061210*.fits'), or
a foreign file containing an ascii list of image filenames. For ascii 
list option, the filename containing the list must be provided 
preceded by a '@' character, e.g. 'outimages=@listoffiles.lis'. This list
must be of the same size as the images argument list. 
.le
.ls outpref
String. If the outpref string is non-zero in length and contains
characters other than a blank space, it will override any value of the
outimages argument. Output file names will use the name list provided
in the images argument, but adding a prefix to the basename of
each  output file defined by outpref. An absolute or relative directory 
path can be included in the prefix, e.g. 'outpref=/Volumes/data/p'.
.le
.ls mbox
Int.  Size of box to be used for median smoothing. 
.le
.ls clobber 
Hidden boolean. If set to 'yes' files contained within the outpath
directory will be overwritten by newly created files of the same
name.
.le
.ls logfile
String. Name of an ascii file for storing log and error messages
written by the task. The file may be new, or messages can also be
appended to a pre-existing file.
.le
.ls (verbose)
Boolean. If verbose=n, log messages will be suppressed.

DESCRIPTION

SALTILLUM median smooths an image and then divides the image by that median
smoothing.  The user can set the box size uesd for the smoothing by setting
the mbox variable to the desired box size.

If the file contains a variance frame, it will also apply the correction
to that frame as well.

EXAMPLES
1. To flat field correct a SALT image:
.nf
    --> saltillum images='@images.lis' outimages='' outpref='f'
        mbox=11 clobber='yes' logfile='salt.log' verbose='yes'
.fi

.ih
TIME AND DISK REQUIREMENTS
Individual unbinned full frame RSS image files can be 112MB in size. It is
recommended to use workstations with a minimum of 512MB RAM. On a
linux machine with 2.8 Ghz processor and 2 Gb of RAM, one 2051x2051 image can 
be processed in 0.31 sec.

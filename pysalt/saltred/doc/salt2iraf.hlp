NAME
salt2iraf -- Convert from MEF to single extension FITS files
.ih
USAGE
salt2iraf images outimages outpref (clobber) (logfile) (verbose)
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls images
String. List of FITS images to prepare. Data can be provided as a
comma-separated list, or a string with a wildcard
(e.g. 'images=S20061210*.fits'), or a foreign file containing an ascii
list of image filenames. For the ascii list option, the filename
containing the list must be provided preceded by a '@' character,
e.g. 'images=@listoffiles.lis'. The list can contain data files from
multiple SALT instruments.
.le
.ls outimage
String. A list of images. Data can be provided as a comma-separated
list, or a string with a wildcard (e.g. 'outimages=rS20061210*.fits'), or
a foreign file containing an ascii list of image filenames. For ascii 
list option, the filename containing the list must be provided 
preceded by a '@' character, e.g. 'outimages=@listoffiles.lis'. This list
must be of the same size as the images argument list. 
.le
.ls outpref
String. If the outpref string is non-zero in length and contains
characters other than a blank space, it will override any value of the
outimages argument. Output file names will use the name list provided
in the images argument, but adding a prefix to each output file
defined by outpref. An absolute or relative directory path can be
included in the prefix, e.g. 'outpref=/Volumes/data/p'.
.le
.ls (ext)
Hidden Int.   The extension number to copy to the Primary Extension.
.ls (clobber)
Hidden boolean. If set to 'yes' files contained within the outpath
directory will be overwritten by newly created files of the same
name.
.le
.ls (logfile)
Hidden String. Name of an ascii file for storing log and error messages
from the tool. The file may be new, or messages can also be appended to a
pre-existing file.
.le
.ls (verbose)
Hidden Boolean. If verbose=n, log messages will be suppressed.

DESCRIPTION
SALT2IRAF converts PySALT Multi-Extension FITS (MEF) files into 
single extension FITS files.   Given a list of images to convert,
it will copy the Primary HDU header information and the data file
appearing in the first extension to the Primary HDU of the output
file.  It will also add any additional information in the first
extension that does not appear in the Primary HDU.  These files
will then be compatible with basic IRAF tasks and other tools.

EXAMPLES
1. To convere raw FITS files residing in the /Volumes/data1/ and create
new files with paths and names stored in the ascii list outimages.lis:

.nf
    --> salt2iraf images='mbxpP*.fits' outimages='' outpref='i' 
        clobber=y logfile='salt.log' verobse=y
.fi

TIME AND DISK REQUIREMENTS
Individual unbinned raw full-frame RSS files can be 112MB in size. It is
recommended to use workstations with a minimum of 512MB RAM. On a
linux machine with 2.8 Ghz processor and 2 Gb of RAM, one 2051x2051 image 
in 0.08 sec.
.ih
BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
The task will raise an error if more than one 'SCI' extension exists
in the images.   If the data is already in single extension, then the
task will copy the image to the output image.

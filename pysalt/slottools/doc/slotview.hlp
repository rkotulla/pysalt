USAGE
slotview images indata fileout srcfile (fps) (phottype) (sigdet) (contpix)  
	 (vignfile) (clobber) (logfile) (verbose)
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls newfits
String. Output fits file from slotphot.  This file should be a multi-extension
fits file containing only images where the target and comparison star appear.
.le
.ls indata
String. Name of the output light curve file from slotphot. The output file is
a 12-column ascii table.  There is one row in the table for each
exposed frame of the image sequence.
.le
.ls fileout
String. Name of the output file. The output file is a 12-column ascii table.
There is one row in the table for each exposed frame of the image 
sequence.  This will only be produced if new photometry is performed.
.le
.ls srcfile
String. Name of the file defining the raw CCD pixel position of two sources
in the image data and defining the size of circular aperture for the 
extraction of source counts and and a circular annulus for the 
extraction of background counts. The file format is an ascii table
with 7 columns and 2 rows. An example is provided below.

.nf
# star amplifier   x   y  r r_bkg1 r_bkg2
# ---------------------------------------
     1         3 193  11 12     13     14
     2         3  37  12 12     13     14
.fi

Rows beginning with the character '#' are ignored. Column 1 contains
a numeric flag for the star which is either 1 or 2. The target star should
be indicated by the value '1' or 't'. This should be the same file used to 
produce the light curve data using slotphot. See slotphot for additional
information about the file.
.le
.ls fps 
Real.  For playing the image data, this is the number of 
frames per second that will appear.  
.le
.ls phottype = [square|circular|cog|optimal]
String.  The type of photometric method used for data analysis.  The
options are: 
.ls "square"
A square aperture with sides of length 2xr in the srcfile is used for both 
target and companion star
.le
.ls "circular"
A circular aperture with radius of r as indicated in the srcfile is used
for both target and companion star
.le
.ls "cog"
Perform curve of growth photometry.  Will measure even placed square
apertures between 2 pix and the br2 radius as indicated in the
srcfile.  The number of square apertures is given by the radius in the
srcfile. The sky background level is deteremined locally between the
br1 and br2 radii.  Photometry is returned in the square aperture with
the maximum signal to noise for the comparison star.  Photometry of
the target star uses an aperture of the same size.
.le
.ls "optimal"
Calculate the optimal ratio between the two sources based X^2 pixel
fit of the comparison star to the object star.  For both stars the
background will be removed and then the comparison star will be used
as a 'model' psf for the X^2 fit.  To simplify the error calculation,
we are assume the errors on the comparison star are much smaller than
the errors on the target star
.le
.le
.ls sigdet
Real.  sigdet is the significance a source must have in order to be
detected in the image.  This is only used in the sub routine that
follows the drift of the comparison star.  If the comparison star has
relatively small drift, this parameter will not be used.  However, if
the drift becomes large or a major shift occurs in the image, slotphot
will detect all nearby objects and select the closest one to the
previous location as the companion star.
.le
.ls contpix
Int. The number of continous pixels a source must have in order to be
deemed a significant detection.  Combined with sigdet, it is used for
tracking a companion star with dramatic drift.  If only small drift
occurs, this parameter is not used.  A large value is typically set so
that comsic rays are not misidentified as the companion star.
.le
.ls driftlimit
Real.  If drifitlimit is set to a positive value, the star will only be
looked for in an area set by this radius.  If no star is found in this area,
the coordinates for the object will remain as in the previous frame.  If drift
limit is negative, the star will be searched for in the entire frame.
.le
.ls vignfile
String. An ascii table containing approximate limits of the vignetting profile
across the SALTICAM SLOT. The table is contained in the 
salt/salticam/data directory and can be modified if the user wishes.
The use of this data is purely cosmetic, providing diagnostic
information in the tools plotting window, and helps the user understand
potential structure in their light curve This functionality is likely 
to be removed or adapted for the next version.
.He
.ls clobber
Hidden Boolean. If clobber=y the tool is permitted to overwrite an existing
file with name outfile.
.le
.ls logfile
String. Name of an ascii file for storing log and error messages
from the tool. The file may be new, or messages can also be appended to a
pre-existing file.
.le
.ls verbose
Boolean. If verbose=n, log messages will be suppressed.
.le
.ih
DESCRIPTION

This tool has been developed primarily to analyze the output from
slotphot and determine the quality of the observations and photometric
analysis of SALTICAM slot mode data.  This task is designed for use
with the output from SLOTPHOT and specifically for SALTICAM slotmode
observations.  SLOTVIEW will plot the light curve, display individual
frames with the target data, and allow new photometry to be performed.

Using the data in the indata file that contains the information about
the light curve, SLOTVIEW will display the lightcurve.  By using the
right mouse button, the user can zoom in on the time curve and examine
a smaller space along the time axis. The graph will automatically
resize the flux ratio axis to the data within the selected time
region. The frame can be reset by clicking on the reset button which
will redraw the original graph over the whole time interval.  By
clicking on any given time, the frame associated with that time will
be displayed.

In addition to display the light curve, slotview will also display
individual frames.  In each of these frames, the amplifier containing
the target star and the comparison star will be displayed.  The target
will be indicated by a yellow box and the comparison star will be
indicated by a green box.  The box size is given by the aperture size
used in the srcfile and is the aperture in which photometry is
performed. The user can watch the time series by using the action
buttons below the image display.  The user can run the series in
forward or revese at the speed set by the fps parameter (single arrow
on the display) or at the maximum speed of the computer system (double
arrow).  The fps parameter gives the frames per second for the
display. 

If needed, the user can perform new photometry on the image.  To
perform new photometry for a single image, simple press 'p' and press
'P' or 'shift+p' to perform photometry on all subsequent images.  To
reset the comparison star in case the object has drifted or
disappeared from the frame, place the mouse near the center of the
object and press 'c'.  The target star should be re-identified as
well, but if it is not or is improperly, the target star can be
identified by placing the mouse over the target star and pressing 't'.
A single frame can be removed from the analysis by pressing 'D', and 
undeleted by pressing 'u' with that frame displayed in the ImageData 
plot.

When complete, the user can close the display either using the quit
button or simply by closing the window.  If any new photometry has
been performed, the fileout file will be written with the new values.
The format for fileout will be the same as the indata file.


.ih EXAMPLES 1. To display the light curve and image from a set of
observations:

.nf
    --> saltview images="object.fits" outfile="object.dat" 
	outfile="object.newdat" srcfile="targets.dat" fps="10" 
	phottype='optimal' sigdet=5 contpix=10 
	vignfile="iraf/extern/salt/salticam/data/SALTICAMslot.def" 
	clobber=y logfile=salt.log verbose=y
.fi
.ih
TIME AND DISK REQUIREMENTS
The newfits file produced by SLOTPHOT may be very large and as such, 
it is suggested that a minimum of 512 Mb of RAM be available for the 
program.  As SLOTVIEW does completely read in the newfits file, this may 
require a large amount of memory and may take some time depending on the
system specifications.
.ih
BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
The current version of SLOTVIEW has been tested only on SALTICAM slot
mode data using slotphot analysis.

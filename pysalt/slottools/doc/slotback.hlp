USAGE
slotback images outfits extension imgtype (subbacktype)

         (clobber) (logfile) (verbose) (debug)

PARAMETERS
.ls images
String. List of images to reduce. Data can be provided as a comma-delineated
list, or a string with a wildcard (e.g. 'images=S20061210*.fits'), or
a foreign file containing an ascii list of image filenames. For ascii 
list option, the filename containing the list must be provided 
preceded by a '@' character, e.g. 'images=@listoffiles.lis'. Note 
that SLOT mode fits files often contain more than one exposed frame.
In such cases, all frames will be reduced by default from any file 
specified in the list of images. saltphot works specifcally only on 
un-mosaiced data. Do not provide any files in this list that have
been created by either the pmosaic, smosaic or saltmosaic tools.
.le
.ls outfits 
String.  If outfits contains a value, then an output fits file only
containing extensions with the target and companion star will be
written out.  If outfits contains none or is left empty, no data will
be written out.  The output images will be background subtracted (if
selected) or just the background image.
.le
.ls extension
Int.  The first exstension (or amplifier) that the target and comparison
star appear on.  This extesnion will be extracted from all of the input
fits files and compiled into a single fits frame.
.le
.ls imgtype = [image|background]
String.  The type of outfits image that is produced. The
options are: 
.ls "image"
A image withe the selected type of background subtraction.
.le
.ls "background"
The background which would be subtracted from the image.
.le
.le
.ls subbacktype
Type of background subtraction used for the sources.  Currently these 
are the options:
.ls none
No background subtraction is done
.le
.ls median
After removing pixels which are sigback above the background
deviation, the image is median smoothed with a bin size set by mbin.
The smoothing is repeated iter number of times.  The smoothed image is
then subtracted from the original image.
.le
.ls surf
After removing pixels which are sigback above the background, a 2-D
polynomial surface with order set by sorder is fit to the image.  The
surface is then subtracted from the image.
.le
.ls both
The image is clipped,  median smoothed, and then fit by a 2-D polynomial.  
The result is subtracted from the image. 
.le
.le
.ls sigback
Real.  Pixels that are sigback times above the background deviation are 
replaced with the average value for the purposes of smoothing or surface 
fitting the image.
.le
.ls mbin
Int.   The bin size of the median smoothing box.  Assumed to be odd integers 
and will be rounded up to the next odd integer if even.
.le
.ls niter
Int.  The number of repeats to apply when smoothing the image.  
.le
.ls sorder
Int.  The order of the 2-D polynomial fit to the image for background 
subtraction.
.le
.ls ampperccd 
Int. The number of amplifiers per CCD.  If it is the newfits file and has already
been processed by slotphot, then set to zero.
.le
.ls ignorexp
Integer >= 0. If ignorexp > 0 the first ignorexp frames will be skipped
over before extraction is performed on ignorexp + 1 and all subsequent
frames. This functionality is useful for SLOT mode data because the 
first few frames are generally empty. This is simply because SLOT 
mode involves continuous readout. The exposed area of the chip is some
way from the readout boundary, so the first few frames of a sequence
will contain CCD bias only.  
.le
.ls clobber
Hidden Boolean. If clobber=y the tool is permitted to overwrite an exisiting
file with name outfile.
.le
.ls logfile
String. Name of an ascii file for storing log and error messages
from the tool. The file may be new, or messages can also be appended to a
pre-existing file.
.le
.ls verbose
Boolean. If verbose=n, log messages will be suppressed.
.le

DESCRIPTION

This task produces an output fits file that either contains background
selected images or the background that would be subtracted from the
images.  The task will select all frames from a given amplifier (as specified 
by extension) and compile them into a single, master fits file.  If imgtype='image',
then the output image will be background subtracted (if selected) images.  If
imgtype='background', the output will be the background that would have been
subtracted from the images.  The outfits file can be placed directly into
slotphot for the purposes of photometry.

If selected, a global background will be subtracted from the data.
The user options allow for four different options.  One, no background
can be subtrated.  Two, the subtracted background can be created from a
median smoothing of the image.  Bright sources will be excluded from
the image by setting the sigback value, and any pixel above that value
will be replaced with the sigma-clipped mean background value.  The median smoothed
image will have a filter window equal to mbin and the filtering will
be repeated the number of times indicated by the iter parameter.
Three, a 2-D polynomial surface of order, sorder, can be fit to the
image and then subtracted.  Bright sources will once again be
excluded.  Finally, the image can be median smoothed and then have a
2-D polynomial subtracted from the unsmoothed image.

Once the outfits file has been satisfactorily created, this file can
be used in slotphot by setting ampperccd=0 and updating the other 
settings.  The srcfile must be updated so the amplifier of the sources
is set to 1.  In addition, the newfits file should be set to 'none', the 
subbacktype should be updated, and ignorexp should be set to zero.  Then, 
by setting the just created newfits file as the input img, slotphot will
only perform photometry on this image.

EXAMPLES
1. To create the background images for stars on amplifier 2:

.nf
    --> slotback images="*.fits" outfits='out.fits', extension=2, 
        subbacktype='median', imgtype='background',
	sigback=2.5, mbin=7, iter=3, sorder=3, 
        ignorexp=0 clobber=y logfile=salt.log verbose=y
.fi
.ih
TIME REQUIREMENTS
A linux machine with 2 GB of RAM and a 2.8 Ghz processer was able to 
process one 4x4 binned SALTICAM slotmode exposures in 0.08 seconds.   
The data were median backgroun subtracted. 
.ih
BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
The current version of SLOTBACK has been tested only on SALTICAM slot
mode data.

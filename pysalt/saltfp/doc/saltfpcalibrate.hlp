DESCRIPTION
The SALT FPI is calibrated by measuring the radii of the rings produced by
monochromatic illumination of the entrance aperture.  Rings at a variety of 
radii are needed to determine the radial variation of wavelength over the
field, and rings from several different spectral lines are needed to determine
the variation of wavelength with the FP control parameter, Z.  Normally,
all the rings are taken in a single FP order, and the observations are taken
in this same order.  In some cases, especially with the higher resolution
etalon, the tuning range of the SALT FP is insufficient to reach an adequate
number of lines in a single order, so lines must be obtained in different
orders.  Both single order and multi-order calibrations can be analysed by
this program.  

The calibration equation fit by this program is:

    Wave * Order = (A + BZ + CZ^2 + DZ^3 + ET) / (1.0 + R^2/F^2)

where the parameters to be determined are A, B, C, D, F, and optionally
E and/or Order.  For single-order fits, the order is set to 1.  The input
data are Z, the FP control value, R, the measured radius of each ring,
Wave, the wavelength of the spectral line that produced the ring, and T, the 
time of the ring observation.

The input to this program is the file of results from the SALTFPCALRING routine.
SALTFPCALRING sets all the relative order values to 0 (ie, single order), so if 
you have multi-order calibration data, you must edit the "dn" column to 
indicate the correct relative order (signed integer) for each line.
SALTFPCALIBRATE reads this data file, makes initial estimates for a linear fit
and then plots four views of the fit.  The "Non-Linear" plot shows the
difference of the wavelengths minus the linear part of the polynomial fit,
as a function of Z; this plot is useful for estimating the order of polynomial
needed to fit the data.  The "Radial" plot shows the ratio of wavelength
at radius R to the central wavelength for each line, as a function of R,
and also plots the fitted radial dependence (curve); this plot is mostly
informational, since there are no parameters the user can modify that will
affect the radial fitting directly.  The "Temporal Drift" plot shows the 
wavelength zero point as a function of time; this plot will guide you in 
selecting whether or not to use a time-variation term in the fit.  The 
"Full Fit Residual" plot shows the difference of the wavelengths minus fitted 
wavelengths, as a function of either Z value, radius, or time.

After the initial plots are displayed, the program asks for your input.
You may type:

?  to get a command summary

1  to select a linear z-polynomial fit (C=D=0.0)

2  to select a quadratic z-polynomial fit (D=0.0)

3  to select a cubic z-polynomial fit

t  to toggle the time variable fit on or off

z  to make the "residual" plot against z values

r  to make the "residual" plot against radius values

h  to make the "residual" plot against time values

e  to edit a point out or back in to the fit
(use the pgplot cursor to click on one of the points in the "Residual" plot)

q  to quit, accepting the current fit

Every time you change one of the fitting parameters, the fit is 
re-calculated, the plots are redrawn, and fit information is shown on your 
terminal.  When you quit the interactive fitting, the fit parameters will 
be written to an output file.

Since SALTFPCALIBTATE is an inherently interactive program, there is no batch 
mode of operation.

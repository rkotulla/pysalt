"""SALTFPPREP is a tool to prepare Fabry-Perot observations for the specific Fabry-Perot reductions using 
T. Williams code.  The code assumes all the files are in the same directory.

Updates:

20100611
    * First wrote the code

20110428
    *Updated the code to work with the output from the salt pipeline
    *Added a number of new features to include in the code

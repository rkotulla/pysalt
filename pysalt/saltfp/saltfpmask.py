"""SALTFPMASK is a tool to aperture mask Fabry-Perot images. Using T. Williams code.  The code assumes all the files are in the same directory. Also assumes that if there is a config file, it is also in the same directory as the data. Note that this config file is in the original FORTRAN code format so that the user does not have to write another file.

Updates:

20100615
    * First wrote the code

20110428
    * Removed the fortran and wrote in pure python

TODO:
* Replace the mean with the biweight estimator
